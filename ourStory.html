                    Lee and Kim first met in Seoul, both working quietly in a small family-run restaurant in Seochon. He
                    was a skilled chef from Busan, learning discipline from years spent in seafood markets and coastal
                    kitchens. She was a self-taught cook with a gift for fermentation and cherished family recipes—her
                    mother’s kimchi and her grandmother’s broths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven by their shared dream, they moved to Japan to study sushi and refine their craft. They spent
                    years perfecting the art of sushi, learning from the masters and immersing themselves in the culture
                    of Japan’s food scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterward, they moved to Paris to further their studies at Le Cordon Bleu. Their time there was full
                    of late nights, precise knife work, and quiet moments together over coffee. This deepened their
                    bond, not just through food but through their shared passion and vision.

                    After graduating, they joined the team at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon on Rue du Bac, where fine
                    technique met culinary artistry. It was also in Paris that they welcomed their first child, Yong,
                    who grew up among the kitchen’s clatter, always nearby as they worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, the family returned to Korea, settling in Jeonju, known for its rich food culture. They
                    ran a small seasonal bistro near the countryside, drawing inspiration from local markets and their
                    own garden, where they grew herbs and vegetables alongside Yong’s toys. For eight years, they honed
                    their craft and embraced the changing seasons of Korea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, settled in Nanaimo, they bring with them the flavors, skills, and memories from their journey.
                    Every dish on the menu is thoughtfully prepared, from Lee’s delicate sashimi cuts to Kim’s
                    comforting broths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yong, now older, helps wherever he can—folding napkins, plating herbs, and offering his honest
                    feedback on each dish.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is more than a restaurant; it’s a living story of tradition, travel, and togetherness.
